            The COVID-19
            pandemic has created many challenges for everyone, including businesses, most notably, small and local ones.
            Many local businesses have been forced to reduce their hours or even close their physical storefront.
            <br><br>During these strange times, customers often turn to the larger franchise businesses, who have teams
            to
            implement and communicate safety precautions at all their locations. As a result, local businesses face
            significant challenges in attracting customers and maintaining their active business.
            The purpose of our website is to reconnect local businesses with their communities. <br><br>This website
            displays
            businesses’ information so you can easily access them on all types of devices, making it easy for you to
            connect with local businesses by displaying virtual storefronts that include information such as open hours,
            delivery options, and COVID-19 policies.
