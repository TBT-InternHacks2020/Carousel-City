        <h1>Sticky Navbar Tutorial</h1>
        <p>Sticky positioned elements is a combination of relative and fixed positioning. Lets understand what that
            means. When a element is positioned as sticky with CSS3, a threshold value is also added along it. Initially
            the element behaves like a normal Relative positioned element. Now as you scroll your webpage, when the page
            reaches the set threshold the element gets stick to that positioned and so the position behavior changes
            from relative to fixed.</p>

        <h3> Introduction</h3>
        <p>Lets briefly understand what we are going to develop. Simple as that, we will have a navigation bar fixed at
            a certain position. Now as your scroll your page, the navbar scrolls as well. Now obviously, we don't want
            to hide our navbar from user coz' that is the guide to browse across our page. So instead of letting the
            navbar scroll beyond the browser viewport, we will be sticking the navigation bar to the top. And as you
            scroll up your contents gets scrolled up while the bar will always be visible at the top. Now lets see what
            are we going to use for the development</p>

        <h3>HTML -- HyperText Markup Language</h3>
        <p>In this tutorial, We have used HTML and CSS to develop sticky navigation Menu. We've made use of sticky
            positioning for that purpose</p>

        <h3>CSS -- Cascading StyleSheet</h3>
        <p>Sticky position is relatviely new to CSS. This is just a hybrid form of relative and fixed position which
            changes at a preset threshold.</p>

        <h3>JS -- JavaScript</h3>
        <p>This tutorial teaches the development of sticky navigation bar with just HTML and CSS. We will be making no
            use of JavaScript at all. Though most web developers use JavaScript for sticky navigation menu since the
            sticky concept on
            CSs is relatively new.</p>

        <h3> Web Development Introduction</h3>
        <p>It's Amazing how Web has reached to every corner of the world flourishing the infromation. Imagine how our
            life could have been, had there not been websites to search visit when you are in deperate need for answers
            or when you are bored. I find myself engrossed in this web entagnlement and get amazed at this wonderous
            achievement of human. If you are reading this portion, Then seriously? What's wrong with You? Focus on
            Development Section. Not within these Paragraphs. These are Just some Fillers</p>
