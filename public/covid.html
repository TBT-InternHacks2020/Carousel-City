        <h1>About COVID-19</h1>
        <p>
            The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as a novel coronavirus, is a new
            coronavirus that has not been previously identified, and different from the coronaviruses that commonly
            circulate among humans.<br>
            <br>COVID-19 originated from Wuhan China in December of 2019. The virus is caused by a coronavirus called
            SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species
            of animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people. This occurred
            with three types of betacoronavirus: MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19. All three of these
            viruses originated from bats.
        </p>

        <h1>Symptoms</h1>
        <p>
            Symptoms of COVID-19 have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness in people. Symptoms may appear 2-14
            days after exposure to the virus. Symptoms include the following and possible others:
            <div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
                <ul>
                    <li>Fever or chills</li>
                    <li>Cough</li>
                    <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
                    <li>Fatigue</li>
                    <li>Muscle or body aches</li>
                    <li>Headache</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
                <ul>
                    <li>New loss of taste or smell</li>
                    <li>Sore throat</li>
                    <li>Congestion or runny nose</li>
                    <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
                    <li>Diarrhea</li>
                </ul><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes
            seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.
        </p>

        <h1>Testing</h1>
        <p>
            Two kinds of tests are currently available for COVID-19: tests for current infection (viral tests) and past
            infection (antibody tests). A viral test recognizes if you have a current infection while an antibody test
            might determine if you had a past infection. It takes 1–3 weeks after infection for your body to make
            antibodies, so an antibody test might not indicate that you have a current infection. It is presently
            unknown whether having antibodies to COVID-19 protects you from getting infected with the virus again or for
            how long.
        </p>

        <h1>How It Spreads</h1>
        <p>
            COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person. Some people without
            symptoms may be able to spread the virus. There is still much to learn about how the virus spreads.
            Person-to-person transmissions include people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6
            feet) and respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks make contact with
            another person’s mucus membrane (located in the inner lips, nose, and elsewhere).<br>
            <br>Information from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic suggests that this virus is spreading more efficiently
            than influenza, but not as efficiently as measles, which is highly contagious. In general, the more closely
            a person interacts with others, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of spreading
            COVID-19.<br>
            <br>COVID-19 is also known to spread indirectly through contaminated surfaces. Depending on the surface, the
            virus can survive on it from a couple of hours to a few days.
        </p>

        <h1>Protective Measures</h1>
        <p>
            Maintaining good social distance (about 6 feet) is essential in preventing the spread of COVID-19. When
            social distancing isn’t an option, wearing a cloth face-covering around others is the best alternative. Soap
            molecules surround the virus that causes COVID-19 and breaks it apart, so it is important to wash your hands
            often with soap and water. When soap and water are unavailable, hand sanitizer containing at least 60%
            alcohol is the next recourse. Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces to kill off the
            virus. The trend is, the harder the surface, the longer the virus survives on it.
